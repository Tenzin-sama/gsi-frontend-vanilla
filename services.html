        <h2>Structural Solutions</h2>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">GSI is involved in the pre-disaster capacity assessment of existing
          structures, post-disaster damage assessment followed by retrofit design implementation for existing structures
          and new design of earthquake-resistant structures via its design center. Moreover; structural engineers and
          geotechnical engineers at GSI are working in collaboration with Ehime University Satellite Office (Kathmandu)
          in the field of earthquake engineering conducting interdisciplinary research, especially after the 2015 Gorkha
          earthquake.

        <h3>1. Microtremor Survey</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Micro-tremor survey of ground and multi-storied buildings for site vs structural response characterization in
          Kathmandu valley, site characterization of Pokhara valley are current studies under the flagship of Ehime
          University Satellite Office. The principal aim of these surveys is to develop seismic micro-zonation maps of
          varying resolutions for various urban and urbanizing areas of Nepal for site based consideration in assessment
          of existing structures as well as in design of new structures.</p>
        <!-- sub service 2 -->
        <h3>2. Post-Earthquake Assessment</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          In the aftermath of the Gorkha earthquake, as part of the post-earthquake damage assessment, the GSI team
          conducted numerous site studies (commercial services included) focusing on both geotechnical and structural
          aspects of observed damages. These site studies primarily focused around the most notably damaged areas of
          Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, Sindhupalchowk and Dolakha districts.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          GSI also facilitated early studies on microtremor monitoring at heritage sites (Basantapur Durbar Square,
          Bhaktapur Durbar Square, Patan Durbar Square, Changu Narayan, Swayambhunath, Pashupatinath, Sankhu,etc.) with
          international scholars from Kagawa University and Ehime University.</p>

        <h3>3. Performance-Based Capacity Assessment of Existing Structures</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Performance-based earthquake engineering (PBEE) analysis techniques are applied in evaluating the capacity of
          existing structures –both masonry and reinforced concrete structures. FEMA 356, ATC 40, ASCE 41 and EN
          1998:2004 are followed in absence of clarifying the information in the technical guideline prepared by the
          Department of Urban Development and Building Construction (DUDBC) Nepal.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Fragility analysis is carried out to quantitatively assess the expected performance of the structure in future
          strong ground motion events. HAZUS MH guideline is followed for the fragility curve generation. Since material
          properties of structural elements play a crucial role in its estimated performance, laboratory testing is
          explicitly carried out for capacity assessment purposes.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          If applicable, capacity assessment results in the need for retrofit intervention for the structure to be code
          compliant for design level performance.</p>
        <!-- sub service 1 -->
        <h3>4. Retrofit Analysis, Design and Implementation</h3>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Retrofit analysis and design are carried out after the capacity evaluation of damaged structures. Economic
          analysis is carried out prior to retrofit design based on the age of the structure, utility value after the
          retrofit, client’s preference, etc. Once economically justified, the retrofit design is carried out based on
          principles of performance-based design.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          In RC framed structures, FEM based modeling is used in the retrofit design. In the case of masonry structures,
          3MURI® based on EN 1998:2004 is used applying Frame by Macro Element (FME) modeling.</p>

        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          GSI in collaboration with Trumer Schutznbauten GmbH, Austria are implementing rockfall, slope and debris flow
          protection measures in Nepal since 2014. Geohazard related any problems have been dealt with expert opinion
          and solutions are provided according to the site characteristics.

          <li><strong>Rockfall Protection Net:</strong>
            <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
              Rockfall protection systems by Trumer Schutzbauten GmbH consist of an interception structure and a support
              or retaining structure. The interception structure is formed by the Omega-Net with its outstanding
              deformability, flexibility and energy absorption. The support or retaining structure consists of posts,
              bearing ropes, retaining ropes and brake elements.

          <li><strong>Slope stabilization:</strong>
            <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
              The slope retention systems by Trumer Schutzbauten consist of the net or wire netting component, which
              constrains the blocks of rock or unstable material, and the anchors that channel the forces into the
              ground. The coupling of the netting to the anchors is achieved through either spike or clamp plates. As an
              option, support ropes can be attached to the netting and anchors in various configurations, distributing
              forces both vertically and horizontally.

          <li><strong>Avalanche Protection:</strong>
            <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
              The avalanche protection systems by Trumer Schutzbauten GmbH utilize the flexible nature and high strength
              of the Omega-Net to prevent avalanches in their first stage of occurrence. Additionally, in scenically
              sensitive areas, the nets are practically transparent and so are an aesthetic alternative to traditional
              snow bridge or snow rack systems.

          geotechnical consulting.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          GSI works with developers, architects, civil design engineers, design-build contractors, school buildings, and
          municipality’s households to determine the geotechnical aspects or needs of a proposed project. We also have
          the expertise and experience to help determine the root causes of problems.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
          Engineers and geologists of GSI typically follow a project from inception to final construction. They ensure
          that quality data gathering techniques are implemented. Once proper sampling and testing is done, we use the
          field and laboratory data, along with geotechnical engineering theory, software, and engineering judgment to
          meet the needs of the projects or clients.</p>
        <p class="fg-blk90 f-20 line-height-34">
